### Hi there 👋

About Me: 

I'm Pranesh and I live in Austin, TX. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. Here's a little more about me

- 💻 Software developer with 10 years of experience in various tech stack, primarily focussed on Frontend/UI/UX development
- 🔭  I'm currently working on React, Python, MySQL, Mocha, React-testing-library, Webpack, Storybook + Agile project management
- 📖 Experienced in leading serveral large scale customer facing products/projects
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to expand my skills on frontend infrastructure/architecture and web performance
- 👯 I'm passionate about leading teams and projects and empowering a team to achieve both business and personal goals
- 💬 What I believe in ? Treating people as people and help them reach their potential by listening and helping them grow


🥅  Goals for 2021

I aspire to grow from being a tech/project lead to an Engineering Manager. One of my main goals for 2021 is improving my leadership skills, listen with empathy on what people want and what empowers them both personally and professionally. I have written quite a bit of frontend code but I have always been enthralled in learning more about the back of the frontend infrastructure/architecture wiz Webpack, Gulp, ESLint, Web performance, Alternative testing frameworks.

☕ Wanna chat ? :) 

I'm always interested in learning and knowing about transitioning from an IC to an Engineering Manager (or) chatting about frontend technologies or just have coffee and talk about an interesting product/company. You can direct message me anytime on my LinkedIn/Twitter
